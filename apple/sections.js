        body: `<p class="by">Jack Libow</p><p>Large corporations are generally the most responsible for the injustices taking place in countries where they source their materials. Often sourcing their materials from a wide variety of countries, it is inevitable that some of the material they source will be done in an inhumane manner. As consumers, we are enabling large companies to continue sourcing their material with troubled working conditions and creating negative environmental impacts through the purchasing of their products. While it might be difficult to get those products elsewhere, buying it might still make us liable. Throughout this interactive map, we will explore the supply chain of Apple, specifically focusing on the working conditions of cobalt mining in the Congo,  manufacturing in China, and the regulations by companies in the United States. This will allow for a holistic view of the measures in place that are responsible for existing injustices, and how that relates to our responsibility as consumers to spark change in the technology industry, specifically regarding Apple.</p>`,

        <p>The Democratic Republic of the Congo controls 64.3% of the world's total cobalt supply (Sovacool, 2021). This has both positive and negative aspects related to this. On the positive side, it gives the DRC a steady stream of wealth, as cobalt is essential for many current electronics. More negatively, this means that if there are human rights violations, the dependency on one country will make it quite difficult to break, due to the importance of cobalt. It also lends itself to the government treating mine workers poorly.</p>
        
        <p><b>Issues</b></p>
        <p>One of the largest issues stems from the prevalence of artisanal small-scale mining (ASM), and the working conditions that many workers face. While the pay is above average in this sector, averaging about $30-$50 a month for workers, the conditions faced by the workers make it an undesirable job that many people are forced to work in due to lack of other sustainable jobs and the decent pay of the job(Sovacool, 2019). Some of the conditions that many workers have to deal with are 8-12 hr walks to the desired destination, while having to carry sacks that weigh upwards of 70 kg (~154 lbs)(Sovacool, 2019). Additionally, there is mass exploitation in the cobalt mining field, with both police, businessmen, and businessmen aiming to build their own wealth at the expense of workers. This was highlighted by the fact that “Expert interviewees identified community members as exploitative of miners in more than half (52.2%) of the interviews and community interviewees identified local firms as exploitative in more than half (54.2%) of the interviews and fellow community members as exploitative in more than a fifth (20.8%) of the interviews" (Sovacool 2021). Clearly, these issues are detrimental as it creates a situation where workers are continuously beaten down, and there are little ways to get out of this, as exploitation will continue to keep them in impoverished conditions. While Apple themselves might be against this worker exploitation, when over 60% of cobalt is being controlled by one country, it limits their options, making them complicit in the issue as well.</p> <img

        <p><b>Environmental Impacts</b></p>
        <p>Cobalt mining creates many sources of pollution. These include river, soil, vegetable, farm, dust, and air pollution. On top of this, high levels of cobalt are present in the bodies of many workers, creating many health issues. The amount of cobalt and metals present in soil was found to exceed the safety limit more than 100 TIMES (Sovacool, 2019). To go a little further in depth on the issue with water, much of this water is used for many purposes that include cooking, bathing, and drinking. Another issue that isn't directly related with cobalt but with the mines themselves is that there are radiation levels above the safe amount near the piles of ore, or even cobalt depots that could have adverse effects. Additionally, deforestation, soil erosion, river ecology changes, biodiversity loss and air pollution are also relevant factors.</p>
        <p><b>Ways to improve</b></p>
        <p>Some ways to improve the working conditions for the people in the cobalt mines would mainly be to set better working standards and for electronics manufacturers and suppliers. One way that working conditions could be expected to be addressed would be in 3 main steps. First of all, having PPE be mandatory for wear could help to greatly decrease the safety risks involved with ASMs. Additionally, having that equipment protected from theft and corruption is also important. This could be done through a mandatory safe with only specific worker access. Finally, having this done in addition to regulation with dust management and ensuring the stability of the ore in the mines could overall improve the safety of the worker in the mine  (Sovacool, 2019). For the tech companies themselves, it is important to not ban the artisanal mining of cobalt, because while not entirely responsibly sourced, it is the livelihood for many of the workers there, and banning it could cause even larger economic distress towards the individuals.</p>

        <p>In 2022, around 95% of Apple Products were manufactured somewhere in China. Around 70% of Apple Products were made by Foxconn: Apple's largest manufacturing subcontractor that is based in China.  Although Foxconn has proved to be a cheap and effective manufacturer for Apple, and has provided jobs for a huge number of Chinese citizens, there are a considerable number of issues that are involved with the company, mostly involving labor injustice.</p>

        <p class="cap">(Achieving Workers' Rights in the Global Economy))</p>
        <p><b>Issues</p></b>
        <p>Throughout the time that Apple has utilized Foxconn as it's main subcontractor for manufacturing, there have been numerous instances of labor injustices involved with their factories. In 2010, the first large case of labor injustice was exposed to the world when reports arose of 18 suicide attempts and 14 confirmed deaths among Foxconn workers(Chan, Pun, & Selden, 2016). These suicides were more than likely driven by the long hours, extremely strict management, and exceedingly low pay present in these factories. A second incident occurred two years later, during the switch from the Iphone 4 to the Iphone 5. With the new Iphone 5, “the increase in output targets placed workers under intense stress", and a Riot among the workers emerged. The riot was huge and very brutal, and “More than forty workers were beaten, handcuffed, and sent off in half a dozen police cars"(Chan, Pun, & Selden, 2016, P. 182). Shortly after this riot, a twenty-one year old worker who had worked at the facility for two years wrote a letter to the CEO of Foxconn, Terry Gou, attached below(Chan, Pun, & Selden, 2016, P. 183).  The worker asks Gou to treat his workers “with a little humanity" and explains how Foxconn “Workers live at the lowest level, Tolerating the most intense work, Earning the lowest pay, Accepting the strictest regulation, And enduring discrimination everywhere"(Chan, Pun, & Selden, 2016, P. 183). This letter, the riots, and the suicides are only a few pieces of evidence that portray the brutal conditions and clear injustice these workers face. More recently, during Covid-19, Foxconn faced a new wave of riots due to production demands associated with the Iphone 14, and harsh living conditions in Foxconn dormitories caused by a covid outbreak(Zhou, 2023). Along with these brutal working conditions, Foxconn has been accused of hiring unpaid child workers. Essentially, Foxconn is able to hire ‘Student Interns', who are often forced by their schools to come work at these plants. Since they are just interns, Foxconn is not required to pay them. One student Interning for Foxconn in an interview states: “‘what do you think we've learned standing for more than ten hours a day manning machines on the line? What's an internship? There's no relation to what we study in school. Every day is just a repetition of one or two simple motions, like a robot'"(Chan, 2018, P. 104).  Since students aren't actually learning anything, and are instead just fulfilling simple job positions that really don't require much teaching at all, it's obvious that Foxconn is simply exploiting these students for their unpaid work.

        <p><b>Environmental Issues</p></b>
        <p>Like the majority of factories and manufacturing plants, Foxconn contributes a significant amount of pollution to the environment. The biggest part of the pollution foxconn puts out is through the wastewater of the facilities. In fact, “the Green Choice Alliance (a platform for
        consumers, civil society, and industries to promote responsible manufacturing processes) found that nickel levels in wastewater discharged by Foxconn and nearby factories were ‘almost 40 times over the limit.'"(Chan, Selden & Ngai 2020, P. 158). Along with wastewater pollution, toxic chemicals like n-Hexane have often been used in factories, and workers have complained of negative health effects due to these products(Chan, Selden & Ngai., 2020).</p>`,

        <b>Legal</b> </p>
        <p>Child labor and forced labor are both violations of international standards of human rights; however, prosecution of companies for human rights violations is the responsibility of the country in which the violations occur. Countries without transparent legal systems or that benefit economically from illegal labor exploitation, turn a blind eye to corporations like Apple who do not end up being prosecuted. Additionally labor exploitation and child labor violations are committed by subsidiaries and providers of Apple and not Apple themselves which allows them a level of immunity even if they incentivize the practice. It is impossible to stop child labor by solely holding the local companies directly responsible. As long as corporations create a demand for cheap resource extraction and manufacturing new local companies will form due to the economic incentive. The United States supreme court has set a precedent that while companies can be sued for violations of international law they must have an effect within national territory and solely the importation and exportation of goods involved in the violation is not enough to constitute a lawsuit.</p>
        <p>The United States supreme court has set a precedent that while companies can be sued for violations of international law they must have an effect within national territory and solely the importation and exportation of goods involved in the violation is not enough to constitute a lawsuit. The Supreme Court case Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum set the “precedent means that the sale of a good to the United States, even one so important and widely purchased like petroleum, does not sufficiently impact the United States enough to justify legal intervention."(Dimri, A)</p>
        <p><b>Capitalism</b></p>
        <p>There are many violations that go unnoticed by the public which Apple does not take actions to prevent. Supply chains in companies as large as Apple are extremely complex and the company needs to begin working with NGOs and governments to more effectively evaluate and track human rights violations in their supply chain.</p>
        <p>The less Apple has to spend on manufacturing and production the more they are able to invest in R&D, advertising, marketing, and other areas of the business in order to maximize their profits. Apple continues to grow its profit margins and taking part in unethical sourcing of materials, manufacturing, and production allows for this continued growth. If Apple restructured their supply chain to better prevent violations it would decrease its own profit margins. The company has a strong economic incentive and lack of accountability to continue allowing for human rights violations in the creation of its products.</p>

        <p>Apart from pollution that occurs in cobalt mining and manufacturing, one way that Apple consumers contribute to climate change, likely unknowingly, is simply through the use of the device themselves. Every time the internet is accessed there are significant negative environmental contributions. This is primarily due to the data centers that are utilized every time the internet is used. According to the paper The overlooked environmental footprint of increasing Internet us “Globally, the Internet use has a carbon footprint ranging from 28 to 63 g CO2 equivalent per gigabyte (GB), while its water and land footprints range from 0.1 to 35 L/GB and 0.7 to 20 cm2/GB" (Obringer et.al) In 2017 alone, these centers put out roughly 3.8 billion kg of carbon into the atmosphere. Furthermore, around 8.5 million square kilometers of land are dedicated to these data centers globally. Since internet use is exponentially increasing, data centers, the carbon they emit, and the land they occupy is increasing dramatically.</p>`,

<p>Apple is the largest company by market capitalization in the US by a substantial margin, and the majority of US citizens own Apple products. Much of the Apple supply chain including cobalt mining in the Congo, manufacturing in China, and unjust regulations in the US involves or contributes to significant labor injustices and negative environmental effects. As consumers it's important for us to realize the injustices and pollution that we are contributing to through the purchasing and use of Apple products. Apple knows that these exist, yet doesn't do nearly enough to stop them, which is partly due to the fact that Apple knows that their consumers don't care enough to do anything about it. With knowledge of these injustices, we hope that you will be willing to teach others of them, and will make more conscious decisions as a consumer.</p>
